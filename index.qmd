# Todd Schoellman

**Principal Research Economist**  
**Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis**

I work on **macro-development**. My main focus is on **human capital** and **labor markets**. I try to quantify the differences in skills and knowledge between workers in different countries; the role of countries, schools, and labor markets in generating these differences; and the implications of these differences for worker incomes and aggregate growth.
